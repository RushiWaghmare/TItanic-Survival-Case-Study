#Titanic Survival Predictor
Technology
Supervised Machine Learning with Logistic Regression using Python

Project Description
This project predicts whether a Titanic passenger would survive or not based on their personal details using supervised machine learning.

The dataset used for this project contains information about passengers, including:

Name
Age
Seat number
Ticket price
Height
Cabin floor
And other features.
Key Steps:
Data Cleaning: We clean the dataset by removing unnecessary entries and columns to improve the model's accuracy.
Feature Engineering: We process features such as encoding categorical variables and filling in missing values.
Logistic Regression: We apply the Logistic Regression algorithm to train our model using the cleaned data and predict passenger survival.

Results
After training the Logistic Regression model, you will get predictions on whether passengers survived based on their data. The results will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
